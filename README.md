# The resilience of the London's underground based on complex network theory and OD spatial interaction model

It is a coursework of CASA0001 Urban Simulation.

This work has two parts.

Part 1: London’s underground resilience

This part investigates the resilience of London’s underground by evaluating the change of the performance when nodes are removed. First, the importance of nodes (i.e. stations) is evaluate based on three centrality measures. Then, two methods are adopted to assess the variation of the network’s performance after nodes removal to investigate London’s metro resilience.

Part 2: Network with flows and Spatial Interaction Models

In this part, passenger flow is taken into consideration and London’s underground is regarded as a directed weighted network. Population and the number of jobs are also considered into analysis to further investigate London’s underground.
